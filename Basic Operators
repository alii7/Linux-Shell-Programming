val=`expr $a + $b`  #   + (Addition)
val=`expr $a - $b`  #   - (Subtraction)
val=`expr $a \* $b` #   * (Multiplication)	
val=`expr $b / $a`  #   / (Division)
val=`expr $b % $a`  #   % (Modulus)
a = $b              #   = (Assignment)
[ $a == $b ]        #   == (Equality)
[ $a != $b ]        #   != (Not Equality)

Relational Operations  [-eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, -ge, -le]  Ex: [ $a -eq $b ] 

!      # inverts a true condition into false and vice versa   (NOT)
-o     # one of the operands is true, then the condition becomes true  (OR)
-a     # both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true otherwise false (AND)

String Operators:

=       # if values are equal then the condition becomes true
!=      # if values are not equal then the condition becomes true
-z      # if it is zero length, then it returns true  [ -z $a ]
-n      # if it is nonzero length, then it returns true  [ -n $a ] 
str     # if it is full, then it returns true
