val=`expr $a + $b`  #   + (Addition)
val=`expr $a - $b`  #   - (Subtraction)
val=`expr $a \* $b` #   * (Multiplication)	
val=`expr $b / $a`  #   / (Division)
val=`expr $b % $a`  #   % (Modulus)
a = $b              #   = (Assignment)
[ $a == $b ]        #   == (Equality)
[ $a != $b ]        #   != (Not Equality)

Relational Operations  [-eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, -ge, -le]  Ex: [ $a -eq $b ] 

!      # inverts a true condition into false and vice versa   (NOT)
-o     # one of the operands is true, then the condition becomes true  (OR)
-a     # both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true otherwise false (AND)

String Operators:

=       # if values are equal then the condition becomes true
!=      # if values are not equal then the condition becomes true
-z      # if it is zero length, then it returns true  [ -z $a ]
-n      # if it is nonzero length, then it returns true  [ -n $a ] 
str     # if it is full, then it returns true

File Test Operators:

-b    # checks if file is a block special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-c    # checks if file is a character special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-d    # checks if file is a directory; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-f    # checks if file is an ordinary file as opposed to a directory or special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-g    # checks if file has its set group ID (SGID) bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-k    # checks if file has its sticky bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-p    # checks if file is a named pipe; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-t    # checks if file descriptor is open and associated with a terminal; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-u    # checks if file has its Set User ID (SUID) bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-r    # checks if file is readable; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-w    # checks if file is writable; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-x    # checks if file is executable; if yes, then the condition becomes true
-s    # checks if file has size greater than 0; if yes, then condition becomes true
-e    # checks if file exists; is true even if file is a directory but exists
