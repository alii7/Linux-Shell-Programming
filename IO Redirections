HERE DOCUMENT:

command << delimiter          #
document                      #      HERE DOCUMENT FORMAT
delimiter                     #

The delimiter tells the shell that the here document has completed.
Without it, the shell continues to read the input forever.
The delimiter must be a single word that does not contain spaces or tabs.

command > /dev/null       # to discard the output by redirecting it to the file /dev/null 
command > /dev/null 2>&1  # to discard both output of a command and its error output, use standard redirection to redirect STDERR to STDOUT
echo message 1>&2         # to display a message on to STDERR by redirecting STDOUT into STDERR

Note : 2 represents STDERR and 1 represents STDOUT


REDIRECTION COMMANDS :

pgm > file           # output of pgm is redirected to file
pgm < file           # program pgm reads its input from file
pgm >> file          # output of pgm is appended to file
n > file             # output from stream with descriptor n redirected to file
n >> file            # output from stream with descriptor n appended to file
n >& m               # merges output from stream n with stream m
n <& m               # merges input from stream n with stream m
<< tag               # standard input comes from here through next tag at the start of line
|                    # takes output from one program, or process, and sends it to another

Note :   the file descriptor 0 is normally standard input (STDIN), 1 is standard output (STDOUT), and 2 is standard error output (STDERR)
