HERE DOCUMENT:

command << delimiter          #
document                      #      HERE DOCUMENT FORMAT
delimiter                     #

The delimiter tells the shell that the here document has completed.
Without it, the shell continues to read the input forever.
The delimiter must be a single word that does not contain spaces or tabs.
