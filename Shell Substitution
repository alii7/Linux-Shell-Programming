echo -e "Value of a is $a \n"       # -e option enables the interpretation of backslash escapes

ESCAPE SEQUENCES :  \\ backslash, \a alert, \b backspace, \c suppress trailing newline, \f form feed, \n new line, \r carriage return, \t horizontal tab, \v vertical tab

COMMAND SUBSTUTITION :

When performing the command substitution make sure that you use the backquote, not the single quote character.

DATE=`date`                                   #
echo "Date is $DATE"                          #
                                              #
USERS=`who | wc -l`                           #     COMMAND SUBSTUTITION EXAMPLE
echo "Logged in user are $USERS"              #
                                              #
UP=`date ; uptime`                            #
echo "Uptime is $UP"                          #

VARIABLE SUBSTUTITION :

${var}                    # substitute the value of var
${var:-word}              # if var is null or unset, word is substituted for var. The value of var does not change
${var:=word}              # if var is null or unset, var is set to the value of word
${var:?message}           # if var is null or unset, message is printed to standard error. This checks that variables are set correctly
${var:+word}              # if var is set, word is substituted for var. The value of var does not change
